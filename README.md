# I Ching Divination Script

## Description

This repository contains a JavaScript-based tool for performing I Ching divinations. The script simulates the [traditional coin-toss method](https://aiching.app/how-to-consult-the-i-ching/) used in the I Ching (also known as the Book of Changes, an ancient Chinese divination text), generating hexagrams and their corresponding interpretations.

The script was created for users who want to cast hexagrams on the [aiching.app](https://aiching.app) website. Users could use the app on their phone but we wanted to create an option for people who maybe could not download the app. It was also created to accompany the book [Embracing Life's Journey Your Guide to Personal Growth with the I Ching](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9SFNR4P)

## Features

- Simulates the process of an I Ching coin toss divination, tossing three coins six times to generate an I Ching hexagram.
- Identifies "changing lines" within the hexagram, which indicate potential transformations to a different hexagram.
- Links to external resources for interpretation of each hexagram, with additional notes for handling changing lines.
