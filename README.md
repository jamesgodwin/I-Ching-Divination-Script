# I Ching Divination Script

## Description

This repository contains a JavaScript-based tool for performing I Ching divinations. The script simulates the traditional coin-toss method used in the I Ching (also known as the Book of Changes, an ancient Chinese divination text), generating hexagrams and their corresponding interpretations.

## Features

- Simulates the process of an I Ching coin toss divination, tossing three coins six times to generate an I Ching hexagram.
- Identifies "changing lines" within the hexagram, which indicate potential transformations to a different hexagram.
- Links to external resources for interpretation of each hexagram, with additional notes for handling changing lines.
